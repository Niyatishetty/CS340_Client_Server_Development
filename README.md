I used the python module to write the CRUD for Project one. I used object oriented programming, I named the class name related to the task I am doing and the functionality of the class it is doing. For dashboard I used lot of python libraries and HTML code. I added lot of comments in my code, so it will be easier to understand. 

I used try/except block to handle the exception. Having used the AnimalShelterCRUD class, and importing that class in the dashboard. Kept the code clean. All the database connections and CRUD operations were done in AnimalShelterCRUD class. The dashboard functionality was separate. It helped in debugging my code. 

the Grazioso Salvare requirements were very clear. They needed Dog which can help in search and rescue operations. My code was designed to filter the records from database and display in the dashboard along with the location map. 

This project was real world requirements, it will be useful to the Grazioso Salvare. This helped me understand how to gather requirements and create the datamodel before start developing the code.
